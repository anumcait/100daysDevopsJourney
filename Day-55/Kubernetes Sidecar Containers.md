# Day 55: Kubernetes Sidecar Containers

**Problem Statement**
We have a web server container running the nginx image. The access and error logs generated by the web server are not critical enough to be placed on a persistent volume. However, Nautilus developers need access to the last 24 hours of logs so that they can trace issues and bugs. Therefore, we need to ship the access and error logs for the web server to a log-aggregation service. Following the separation of concerns principle, we implement the Sidecar pattern by deploying a second container that ships the error and access logs from nginx. Nginx does one thing, and it does it well‚Äîserving web pages. The second container also specializes in its task‚Äîshipping logs. Since containers are running on the same Pod, we can use a shared emptyDir volume to read and write logs.

Create a pod named webserver. 

Create an emptyDir volume shared-logs.

Create two containers from nginx and ubuntu images with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest, nginx container name should be nginx-container and ubuntu container name should be sidecar-container on webserver pod.

Add command on sidecar-container "sh","-c","while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"

Mount the volume shared-logs on both containers at location /var/log/nginx, all containers should be up and running.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

To achieve this:
- We'll ship the logs to a log-aggregation service using the **Sidecar Container Pattern**.  
- The **nginx container** focuses on serving web pages.  
- The **sidecar container** focuses on reading and shipping logs.  
- Both containers share a common volume using **emptyDir**.

## üéØ Requirements

1. Create a pod named **`webserver`**.
2. Create an **emptyDir** volume named **`shared-logs`**.
3. Add **two containers**:
   - `nginx-container` using `nginx:latest`
   - `sidecar-container` using `ubuntu:latest`
4. The **sidecar-container** should run the following command:
   ```bash
   sh -c "while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"
   ```
5. Mount the shared volume /var/log/nginx on both containers.

6. Ensure all containers are up and running.

## üß© Solution

Create a YAML file named webserver.yaml with the following content:
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webserver
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx

    - name: sidecar-container
      image: ubuntu:latest
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx
```
## üöÄ Deployment Steps

Apply the YAML file:
```bash
kubectl apply -f webserver.yaml
```

Verify the pod status:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Expected output:
```bash
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webserver    2/2     Running   0          10s
```
## üîç Verification

Check logs from the sidecar container to ensure it's reading Nginx logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -f webserver -c sidecar-container
```

You should see access and error logs printed every 30 seconds.
