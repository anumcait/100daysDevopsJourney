## 🚀 Day 14 | KodeKloud 100 Days DevOps Challenge 🚀

### The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.

#### Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not have hosted any code yet on these servers, so you don’t need to worry if Apache isn’t serving any pages. Just make sure the service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 8082 on all app servers.

Issue: Apache service failing to start due to port 8082 already in use.

Fix:
✔️ Identified and killed the process occupying port 8082 
```bash
```
✔️ Restarted Apache service (httpd)

Result: Apache up and running on port 8082 successfully.
